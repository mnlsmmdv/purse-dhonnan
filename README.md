# Purse Dhonnan
This is a batch file that makes various changes to a Microsoft Windows system, including: removing certain icons from the taskbar, showing "This PC" on the desktop, enabling remote desktop connections, adding a language, setting the time zone, preventing sleep mode, setting Chrome as the default browser, and setting VLC as the default media player. This batch file should be compatible with Microsoft Windows 7, 8, 10 and 11. These are operating systems that support the Windows command line language and the registry editor, which are used in the script. However, it is recommended to test the script on a non-production / work environment before deploying it on a live system to ensure compatibility and avoid any unintended consequences.
